## How to Open an Issue

4. Provide a clear and descriptive title.
5. In the description, explain the problem or desired feature in a simple and concise manner.
6. Make sure to include any relevant information, such as the operating system or software version.

## Labeling Issues
- Use labels to categorize issues. For example, use "bug" for problems and "enhancement" for new features.
- Assign labels to issues based on their type and importance.
